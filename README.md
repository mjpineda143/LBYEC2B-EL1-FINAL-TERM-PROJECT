# LBYEC2B-EL1: FINAL TERM PROJECT

## IEnlist v3.0

The first step to attaining the ideal schedule to further better the student’s time management skill is to be aware of all the available courses, pre-requisites, hard-requites, and units in a given term—as these are major determining factors of the resulting term timetable. This IEnlist v3.0 program aims to guide Industrial Engineering students from ID 118, 119, and 120 to determine all the necessary information (ex. Units, co-requisites) about their subjects in term 3; all of which are based on the updated IE flowchart. The algorithm will also provide a list of GE subjects that would be available, and determine if the student’s chosen schedule results in a subject overload. Through this, the student would be further informed on all the necessary requirements needed to take a certain course, properly construct a suitable schedule, and ultimately manage their time wisely.
<br><br>Objectives:
<br>1. To develop a user-friendly interface that aids 120, 119, and 118 DLSU Industrial Engineering students in being aware of the courses available for the third term of the academic year.
<br>2. To guide the students in the prerequisites and corequisites needed to take a certain course.
<br>3. To further assist the students in determining if they are overloading or underloading for the term.
